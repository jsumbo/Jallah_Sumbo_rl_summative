Reinforcement Learning Summative Assignment

## Reinforcement Learning in Liberian Entrepreneurship Education

This repository contains a comprehensive reinforcement learning project that implements and compares four different RL algorithms (DQN, REINFORCE, PPO, and Actor-Critic) in a custom environment designed to simulate entrepreneurial learning for Liberian secondary school students.

### 🎯 Project Overview

The project addresses the gap between traditional education and practical entrepreneurial skills by creating an AI simulation where agents learn to navigate the challenges of starting and running a business in Liberia. The custom environment incorporates culturally relevant scenarios including resource constraints, market dynamics, and skill development opportunities.

### Environment: Liberian Entrepreneurship Simulation

The custom environment simulates a young Liberian student learning entrepreneurship through:

- **10x10 Grid World**: Navigate between different business locations
- **Multiple Location Types**: 
  - 🏫 Schools (skill development)
  - 🏦 Banks (loan applications)
  - 🏪 Markets (product sales)
  - 📦 Suppliers (inventory purchase)
- **Dynamic Market Conditions**: Changing demand, competition, and economic stability
- **Skill Development**: 5 entrepreneurial skills that improve over time
- **Resource Management**: Balance money, inventory, and business growth

#### Action Space (14 actions)
- **Movement (0-7)**: Navigate in 8 directions
- **Study/Learn (8)**: Improve skills at schools
- **Apply for Loan (9)**: Get capital from banks
- **Buy Inventory (10)**: Purchase products from suppliers
- **Sell Products (11)**: Generate revenue at markets
- **Market Research (12)**: Improve market knowledge
- **Customer Service (13)**: Enhance customer satisfaction

#### State Space (11 dimensions)
- Agent position (x, y)
- Financial status (money, business level)
- Market conditions (demand, competition, stability)
- Agent capabilities (knowledge, satisfaction, inventory, skills)
